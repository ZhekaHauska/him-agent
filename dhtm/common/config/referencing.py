class ConfigResolver:
    """
    ConfigResolver is a class that resolves the config of an object or any sub-config in general.

    In most cases object constructors expect a dictionary config with named args. For dict configs
    we support the "_base_" meta key that allows to reference another dict config to take it as
    base config and override it with the current dict. Such referencing is recursive, i.e. the base
    config may also have a "_base_" key, and so on.

    We treat "_base_" as a dot-separated key path to the base config, i.e. path containing a
    sequence of keys that are used to recursively select subconfigs from the global config.
    For example "path.to.config" means following structure:
    path:
        to:
            config: <base config>

    If the key path starts with "$" it means that the first key of the path is a name (without
    extension) of the config file to load. The tail of the path is used to select the base config
    from the loaded config. For example "$another_config.path.to.config" means the same as above,
    but the base config is loaded from the "another_config.yaml" file in the same folder as the
    current global config file.

    To prevent repeated loading of the same external config, the whole loaded config is added to
    the global config under its root key (e.g. "$another_config"), so the key path resolution
    works with only "local" key paths as is.

    The `default_base_path` is used to resolve the key path when the key path is a single key.
    In this case provided key is treated as a key in the same parent collection as the last key
    of the `default_base_path` key path. For example, if the `default_base_path` is
    "path.to.obj1_config" and the key path is "obj2_config", then it is treated as:
    path:
        to:
            obj1_config:
            obj2_config: <base config>

    In several cases config is a list (e.g. if object is a list or tuple). As they don't have
    named args, we don't support referencing with "_base_" key.

    However, for both cases we support direct referencing with a single string key path.
