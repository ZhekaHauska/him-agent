# TODO:
#  - allow multiple base configs. Allow overrides that override entirely the list or append to it
#  - improve working with external imports (from another files) and relative imports
#  - allow recursive config resolution/substitution (e.g. merge nested dicts with resolution)
#  - allow local base configs (they need to be masked out)
#  - specify separation of configs: raw base config + overrides, constructed resolved namespace,
#       visible resolved configs (if it is needed). Which one should be logged?
#  - solve problem with dynamic overrides order (before or after base config resolution)
#  - decide, whether we should dynamically induce __init__ params from an object to
#       understand whether or not it needs common params (seed, global_config, etc.),
#       and whether we want them to be resolved implicitly or explicitly
