    (SDRR) stored in a compressed format:
        - sdr stores non-zero indices
        - values stores the corresponding non-zero values

    In most SDRR-related computations float values in [0, 1] are expected,
    representing relative rate or probability-like values â€” this is the main
    purpose of the structure.
    However, it may also be useful for other purposes, like to aggregate
    SDR-related int/float statistics. Therefore, the structure itself
    does NOT restrict the type or range of values.

    NB: Be careful mutating values. By default, consider RateSdr objects as immutable.
