@dataclass
class RateSdr:
    """
    Represent non-binary rate SDR aka Sparse Distributed Rate Representation
    (SDRR) stored in a compressed format:
        - sdr stores non-zero indices
        - values stores the corresponding non-zero values

    In most SDRR-related computations float values in [0, 1] are expected,
    representing relative rate or probability-like values â€” this is the main
    purpose of the structure.
    However, it may also be useful for other purposes, like to aggregate
    SDR-related int/float statistics. Therefore, the structure itself
    does NOT restrict the type or range of values.

    IMPORTANT: rates have a bit of obscure nature!
        - each rate is a value in [0, 1] representing independent rate of the neuron
        - it is relative to the neuron's maximum possible rate
        - we employ rate normalization: the output of a layer is always re-normalized in
            such way, that the most successful neuron will have a rate of 1. And the other
            winners will have their rates relative to the 1st.
        - therefore the following properties of RateSdr should be expected:
            - the absolute bit rate does not mean absolute strength of the recognition. Instead,
                it means how relatively good it recognizes the input pattern.
            - there is no way ATM to represent the certainty of recognition. In the future,
                it will be modelled with the size of RateSdr, such that the bigger size will
                mean less certainty and vice versa.
        TODO: draft; to be finalized after testing.

    NB: Be careful mutating values. By default, consider RateSdr objects as immutable.
