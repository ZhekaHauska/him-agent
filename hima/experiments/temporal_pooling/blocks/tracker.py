    TrackerBlock wraps a single tracker object in a block to be used in a model graph.

    It loosely binds tracked streams with the tracker's handling methods by re-routing
    a stream's "on_change" event to the corresponding handling method. That is, any stream
    knows only about TrackerBlocks, and these blocks know how to re-route events to
    the corresponding trackers' handling methods.

    The block also takes the burden of collecting the emitted metrics and placing them
    to the model's centralized metrics storage.
